# Project Portfolio

The first assessment as part of Coder Academy's FlexTrack Coding Bootcamp. This project entails the design and development of my first ever website, which will eventually become an acting portfolio for any of my projects - ongoing and completed.

This project utilises a rudimentary application of HTML and CSS to create a functioning and aesthetically pleasing four-page website. The development process was mapped via GITHUB and the wireframes were laid out using Balsamiq.

# Development Notes
13/04/2021 -- 
    
    (11:20am) First managed to successfully push files and code to GITHUB repository. CSS currently quite messy and working on wireframes to clean up website design. Barebones laid down for webpages. 
    (2:30pm) Updated remote and local git repositories by branching all webpages and CSS folder locally then pushed them to the origin. Wireframes have now been created, HTML and CSS file names updated to allow for more cohesion - time to begin the focus on coding. 
    (3:45pm) Updated Nav bar on website by adding more pseudo styling and added comments to CSS files to distinguish syntax.
