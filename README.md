# Project Portfolio

The first assessment as part of Coder Academy's FlexTrack Coding Bootcamp. This project entails the design and development of my first ever website, which will eventually become an acting portfolio for any of my projects - ongoing and completed.

This project utilises a rudimentary application of HTML and CSS to create a functioning and aesthetically pleasing four-page website. The development process was mapped via GITHUB and the wireframes were laid out using Balsamiq.
